## 🔥 Burn Mechanism Analysis

### Fee Structure:
- **Total Fee**: 0.25% (25 basis points) of transfer amount
- **Fee Split**: 40% to fee recipient, 60% burned
- **Effective Burn Rate**: 0.15% of each transfer
- **Fee Recipient Rate**: 0.1% of each transfer

### Test Case: 1500 Token Transfer
| Metric | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Transfer Amount | 1500 tokens | 1500 tokens | ✅ |
| Total Fee | 3.75 → 3 tokens | 3 tokens | ✅ |
| Burn Amount | ~2 tokens | 2 tokens | ✅ |
| Fee Recipient | ~1 token | 1 token | ✅ |
| Net to Recipient | 1497 tokens | 1497 tokens | ✅ |

### Burn Statistics:
- **Total Burned**: 5 tokens across all tests
- **Total Transferred**: 3500 tokens
- **Effective Burn Rate**: 0.14% (very close to target 0.15%)
